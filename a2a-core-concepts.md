# A2A Protocol's Core Concepts

Understanding the core concepts of A2A protocol is crucial for developing or integrating with A2A-compliant systems.

## Actors

The Core Actors of A2A protocol.

### User

- It initiates a request or goal that requires agent assistent.
- The end user.
- Humans or automated service.

### A2A Client(Client Agent)

- It acts on behalf of the user to request actions or information from a remote agent.
- An applicaton, service, another AI agent, etc.

### A2A Server(Remote Agent)

- It receives requests from clients, processes tasks and returns result or status updates.
- An AI agent or agentic system that exposes an HTTP endpoint implementing the A2A protocol which is opaque.

## Communication Elements

The fundamental communication elements of A2A protocol.

### Agent Card

- A JSON metadata document that describes an A2A server.
- It is discoverable at a well-known URL pathname: `/.well-known/agent.json`
- It details the agent's:
  - name
  - description
  - service endpoint URL
  - version
  - capabilities (like streaming or push notifications)
  - sklls
  - default input/output modalities
  - authentication requirements
- Clients use the agent card to discover agents and understand how to interact with them.

### Task

- When a client sends a message to an agent, the agent might determine that fulfilling the client's request requires a stateful task to be completed.
- Each task has a unique ID defined by the agent
- It progresses through a defined lifecycle:
  - `submitted`
  - `working`
  - `input-required`
  - `completed`
  - `failed`
- A task is stateful.
- A task can involve multiple messages (multiple exchanges).

- [`Task` Object](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/specification/#61-task-object)

### Message

- It represents a single turn
- It represents unit of communication.
- A message has a `role`(e.g. `user` for client-sent messages or `agent` for server-sent messages).
- A message contains one or more `Part` objects that carry the actual content.
- A `Message` object has an unique identifier, `messageId` for each message set by the sender of the message.
- [`Message` Object](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/specification/#64-message-object)
- Used for conveying:
  - instructions
  - context
  - questions,
  - answers,
  - status updates
    - that are not necessarily formal `Artifacts`.

### Part

- An unit of content within a `Message` or an `Artifact`.
- Each part has a specific `type` and can carry different kindds of data:
  - `TextPart`: plain textual content.
  - `FilePart`: Represents a file, which can be transmitted as inline base64-encoded bytes or referenced via a URI. Includes metadata like filename and Media Type.
  - `DataPart`: Carries structured JSON data, useful for forms, parameters, or any machine-readable information.
- [Part Union Type](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/specification/#65-part-union-type)

### Artifact

- A tangible output.
- A result generated by the remote agent during the processing of a task.
- For examples:
  - documents
  - images
  - spreadsheets
  - structured data results
  - any other self-contained piece of information that is a direct result of the task.
- Artifacts are composed of one or more `Part` objects.
- It can be streamed incrementally.
- [`Artifact` Object](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/specification/#67-artifact-object)

## Interaction Mechanisms

### Request/Response(Polling)

- `message/send` RPC method: client sends a request and receives a response from the server.
- If the interaction requires a stateful long-running task, the server might initially respond with a `working` status.
- The client would then periodically call `tasks/get` to poll for updates until the task reaches a terminal state(e.g. `completed`, `failed`)

### Streaming(Server-Sent Events - SSE)

- `message/stream` RPC method: client initiate an interaction with the server.
- For tasks that produce results incrementally or provide real-time progress updates.
- The server responds with an HTTP connection that remains open, over which it sends a stream of SSE.
- These events can be:
  - `Task`
  - `Message`
  - `TaskStatusUpdateEvent`: for status changes
  - `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`: for new or updated artifact chunks
- This requires the server to advertise the `streaming` capability in its Agent Card.

### Push Notifications

- For very long-running tasks or scenarios where maintaining a persistent connection (like SSE) is impractical터무니없을정도로.
- The client can provide a webhook URL when initiating a task
  - or by calling `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set`.
- When the task status changes significantly (e.g., completes, fails, or requires input), the server can send an asynchronous notification (an HTTP POST request) to this client-provided webhook.
- This requires the server advertise the `pushNotifications` capability in its Agent Card.
